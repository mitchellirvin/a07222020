File: `src/components/Admin/index.js`

Topic : Converting one file from class based to functional based

See `src/components/Admin/index_orig_class.js` for working class version.

Issue:  Code compiles but getting a runtime error

`TypeError: users.map is not a function`

Task: PR to fix issue

Please minimize change and do not include linter changes such as changing quotes.
A one line change is ok and indeed preferred!

.env has info and you can use 6@6.com 666666 for a login
